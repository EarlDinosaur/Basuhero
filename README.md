A trash sorting game built with LÖVE (Love2D) where players must sort falling trash into the correct bins before they cross the line.

## Description

BASUHERO is an educational rhythm-based game that teaches players about proper waste segregation. Players must quickly identify and sort falling trash items into their appropriate bins (Compostable, Recyclable, or Non-recyclable) before they cross the line. The trash items fall in sync with the background music, creating an engaging rhythm-based gameplay experience.
